OpsMaru is a deployment platform creator. It helps developers setup platforms and also configures your applications for continuous deployment.

To get started first thing you'll need to do is [sign up](/auth/users/register) for an account.

You'll be taken through the process and asked to connect your github account.

## Initial Setup

Once you've reached the dashboard of your organization click the `Infrastructure Builder`.

There are a few basic concepts to understand when using OpsMaru. You need a target platform to deploy to. This can be any cloud provider you choose. Currently we support 2, we'll be adding more to this list soon.

+ AWS
+ DigitalOcean

You can choose to bootstrap your account by selecting one of the templates in the Infrastructure Builder
